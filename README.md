# About CMA-VNS

CMA-VNS is an award-winning algorithm. CMA-VNS has won all three tracks in the [CBBOC 2015](http://web.mst.edu/~tauritzd/CBBOC/GECCO2015/) competition ([C++ API](https://github.com/cbboc/cpp)) and all the two tracks in [CBBOC 2016](http://web.mst.edu/~tauritzd/CBBOC/GECCO2016/).

# How to cite

# How does it work

As its name, CMA-ES goes first, VNS then takes the baton from CMA-ES in the relay race.

For more details, please refer to the papers.

# When to use CMA-VNS

When your optimization problem is huge, expensive, way too complex.
